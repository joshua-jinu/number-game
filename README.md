// Challenge 1 :- Reference the play button and on click of it the startGame() function should be called
// Expectation of the function :- visibility  of the play button and the game container changes  when the play button is clicked, ensuring that the game starts as expected.


 // Challenge 2 :- Complete function generateRandomNumbers that will generate Randomnumbers. You will need to reference elements from the DOM and change its innerHTML value to be Random numbers.
